# Estimation-of-Gait-Parameters-and-Machine-Learning-Classification
This project estimates gait parameters from the 3D pose data estimated from RGB and depth images captured from the Kinect sensor. Initially data is read from excel sheet and frames are sorted by frame numbers. Missing values are filled by interpolating and frames with missing values after this, are dropped. Using the 3D pose data Knee Flexion angle and pelvic tilt are calculated and plotted for all frames to form gait cycles. Plots are smoothened and algorithm is developed to capture the start and end of the gait cycles and parameters are extracted. DTW is calculated for different experiments of a person, to form feature set to classify a person if he has a cognitive disease or not. KNN, decision tree, random forest classifiers are used for classification.
